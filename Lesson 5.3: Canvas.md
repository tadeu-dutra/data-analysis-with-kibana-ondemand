# Summary

In this lab, you created a workpad with a visualization from the Kibana visualization library.

# Review

- Lens visualizations may be used in Canvas. Any visualization can be saved to the library and used in Canvas.
- By default, elements will use demo data. You can change the data source to be Elasticsearch raw documents to use Lucene queries to query Elasticsearch, or Elasticsearch SQL to query Elasticsearch using SQL. If you're familiar with Timelion, you can also use that syntax to query Elasticsearch.
