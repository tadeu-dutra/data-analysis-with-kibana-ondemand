# 1.1: Introduction to Kibana

In this lesson, you’ll learn that Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Beats are components of the Elastic Stack. You’ll also learn how Kibana can be used to manage the Elastic Stack and used to add, explore, visualize, present, and share your data.

# Summary:

In this lab, you installed all of the sample data sets that ships with Kibana. You also saw some of the features of Kibana by exploring the visualizations that loaded with the sample data. In the next lab, you will learn how to build your own dashboard.

# Review
