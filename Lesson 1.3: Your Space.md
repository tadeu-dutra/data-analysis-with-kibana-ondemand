# 1.3: Your Space

In this lesson, you’ll learn how Spaces can be used to organize dashboards, visualizations, and other Kibana objects. You’ll also learn how to easily copy Kibana objects from one space to another from Saved Objects.

In this lab, you will create a new space called Nova. You will then copy over your new dashboard (and its related objects) to this new space.

NOTE: This is the copied dashboard from the Default space to Nova space.


# Summary:

In this lab, you learned about how you can use Kibana spaces to organize your dashboards and other visualizations.




# Review

- By default, when you access Kibana, you will work in the default space called Default.
- To separate workspace for users working with the same dataset, you can set up separate spaces for different users.
- Using the Copy to space functionality from Saved Objects you can share dashboards between spaces.
- Create users with different roles to set specific data access permissions using Security.
