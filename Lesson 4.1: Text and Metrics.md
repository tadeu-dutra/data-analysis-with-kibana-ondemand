# Lesson 4.1: Text and Metrics

In this lesson, you’ll learn how metrics show a single number and how various mathematical formulas may be applied. You’ll also learn how text can add content to dashboard panels, and how to add links and images to your dashboards.

In this lab, you will add Text panels to your dashboards as well as add metric visualizations using Lens.

- Add links to other dashboards to make it easier for your users to navigate between dashboards.
- The Text editor enables you to use Markdown.
