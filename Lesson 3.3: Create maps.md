# Lesson 3.3: Create maps

In this lesson, you’ll learn how maps can use geospatial fields to display records and join keywords to regional data. You’ll also learn how multiple map types may be used in a single visualization, and that each layer can be hidden, cloned, edited, removed, or fit. Finally, you’ll learn how each map has colors, tooltips, and labels that can be customized.

In this lab, you will create maps from the web logs sample data.

# Review

- A choropleth displays regional boundaries.
- Two geopoint fields must be available in a document for a Point to Point map.
- Fit to data, remove, hide, clone, and edit are all actions that can be taken on a layer.
