# 7.2. Runtime fields

Ideally, your data schema is defined at index time. However, there are situations where you may want to define it on the fly. In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn how you can use runtime fields to do so.


In this lab, you will create, query, and visualize a runtime field.

# Summary:

In this lab, you created, queried, and visualized a runtime field.



# Review
- Use the Painless language.
- Use emit to return a value. The value can be accessed using the doc map. Ex: emit(doc['my_field'].value)
- Although runtime fields can be quite useful in certain instances, you should use them with caution, because they can be computationally expensive.
