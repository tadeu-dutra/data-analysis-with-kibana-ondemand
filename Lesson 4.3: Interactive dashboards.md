# Lesson 4.3: Interactive Dashboards

In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn how you can interact with dashboards. You'll see that clicking values in a visualization will create filters that are applied to the dashboard. You'll also see how you can customize what happens when someone clicks on a value using drilldowns.

In this lab, you will learn how to create interactive dashboards by adding controls and drilldowns on your dashboards.

# Summary:

In this lab, you created multiple controls and saw how they interact with each other. You also defined a drilldown for the pie chart visualization.



# Review

- Creating filters can be as simple as clicking a value in a visualization.
- An end user of your dashboard doesn't need to know about the fields of an index to create a filter.
- A user can filter data on a dashboard by:
    - Clicking Add filter in the top left
    - Clicking a value in a visualization
    - Selecting a value in a Control
    - ...
  - Dashboard drilldowns enable you to open a dashboard or another web page from another dashboard, taking the time range, filters, and other parameters with you so the context remains the same.
