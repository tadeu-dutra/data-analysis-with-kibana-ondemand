# 5.2: Sharing with users

In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn how you can use roles, permissions, and spaces to share dashboards with others.


# Review

- Roles are a collection of privileges that allow you to perform actions in Kibana and Elasticsearch.
- Roles provides authorization to specific actions.
- Anonymous authentication will provide access to all of Kibana, so restrict the privileges of the anonymous user.
- Users can be assigned a role that only provides access to spaces that have limited features enabled.
- You can use roles to limit the spaces that users with those roles have access to. Those spaces can then be configured with a limited set of features.
