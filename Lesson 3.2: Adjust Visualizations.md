# 3.2: Adjust Visualizations

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to show, hide, and adjust labels, ticks, axes, and legends on your Lens visualization. You’ll also learn how to change the bounds of your vertical axes to reveal more details in your chart and how time series charts can be displayed with a time shift. Finally, you’ll learn how to add annotations and reference lines to your visualizations to call out important values or thresholds on your chart. Watch the video below to learn more.

# Review

- You can compare your data over different time frames using an offset. Graph a daily revenue chart and duplicate it with an offset of one week
- There is a dashboard option to hide all panel titles at once.
