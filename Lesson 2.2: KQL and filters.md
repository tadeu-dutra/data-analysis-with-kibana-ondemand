# Lesson 2.2: KQL and filters

In this lesson, you’ll learn how Kibana filters and the query bar are complementary and how they can be used. You’ll also learn what the KQL language supports and how KQL provides auto-completion for writing queries.

In this lab, you will use KQL and filters to build queries on the web logs data set.
