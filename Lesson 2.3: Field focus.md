# 2.3: Field focus

In this lesson, you’ll learn how the Visualize button in Discover creates Lens or Maps visualizations. You’ll also learn how visualizations can be used to create filters, change the time filter, and be saved to dashboards.

In this lab, you will create visualizations of the web logs sample data and add them to your dashboard.

# Summary:

In this lab, you created new Maps and Lens visualizations of the web logs data and added them to your dashboard. You also created a filter from a visualization and loaded a saved query.


# Review

- The geo point data will create a Map by default.
- You can use the layer pane to change the number of values that are shown for a specific field.
- It’s very easy to change visualization styles directly in Lens using the Worksplace or Suggestions tools.
