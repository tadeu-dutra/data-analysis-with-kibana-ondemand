# 2.1: Discover and Data Visualizer

In this lesson, you’ll learn how you can use Discover to explore your data. You'll see how data types influence how fields may be used in Kibana and how the Data Visualizer can be used to inspect a data view as a whole. You’ll also learn how Discover can be used to drill down into specific documents and how the time filter and data view in Discover form the context of the view. Finally, you’ll review how the document table can be customized to show selected fields.

In this lab, you will work with Discover and Data Visualizer to explore the web logs sample data set in more detail. You will also import a CSV log file into Kibana.
