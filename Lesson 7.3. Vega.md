In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn how you can use Vega and Vega-Lite to create custom visualizations.


# Review

- To retrieve data from Elasticsearch, specify in the "data" clause, a "url" clause with a "timefield", an "index" and a "body". Also include a "format" clause in the "data" clause, with the "property" in the response you want to visualize.
- Vega visualizations are like any other visualization and can be added to dashboards.
- You can combine "context" and "timefield" to keep dashboard context and filters in your Vega visualization.
