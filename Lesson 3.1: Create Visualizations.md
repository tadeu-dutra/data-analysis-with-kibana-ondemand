# Summary:

In this lab, you added few more visualizations to your dashboard and customized the display of data.


# Review

- While they do not share the same field groups, you can switch between a pie chart and a bar graph, Lens will adapt field groups to different visualizations.
- Often, there is no right or wrong way to visualize your data. Choose the visualization type that works best for you. Ex: Any of the following can be a good visualization type to show proportional data:
  - Donut
  - Pie
  - Treemap
  - Porcentage Bar
- Use the Layer Page to control the number of values to show in a top values graph. Just click on the field group you're interested in changing.
