# Summary

# Review

- Reports can be generated from the dashboard.
- A POST URL can be used to generate a report from custom code or using a Watch.
- Links will always get the latest updated data but may not reflect changes to the dashboard itself.
- PDF reports can be used to print your dashboards and share dashboards with folks who do not have access to Kibana. You can also use Watcher to generate and email PDF reports according to a regular schedule. Summarizing:
  - When you'd like to print a dashboard
  - When you'd like to share a dashboard with someone who does not have access to Kibana
  - When you'd like to regularly share a dashboard via email
